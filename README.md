## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second part of the assignment was to build a mount.  It was a square with 120 mm length on each side. It is 8 mm thick and has 5 holes in it.  The 4 on the outside have a 10 mm diamiter and are 20 mm away from the edges of the mount.

### Reflection

It was way easier than I thought it would be.  Following the video helped with getting through all the little setbacks I had.  I'm glad I am starting to figure this onshape stuff out.

## Fork

### Description

I just made the fork.  It is a circle that is 8 mm thick with 2 rectangles coming out that are curved at the top.  It also has a hole going through each of them that is 15 mm from the top.  The diamiter is 10 mm

### Reflection

This part had a lot more steps and I had some trouble with the fillet tool.  I went to office hours to figure it out.  I think it is all starting to come together for me and I'm excited to see my final form of this project when I put it all together.

## Tire

### Description
I just made the tire.  First i made a trapezoid that is 20 mm in length.  I made the angle of the sides of the trapezoid 10 degrees.  After that I revolved it to make it a circle, then i added some fillets to round it out and changed the color so it looked more like a tire.

### Reflection

The tire was one of the easiest parts to make so far.  All it really is is a trapezoid that is revolved.  Im starting to get onshape.  It is starting to get easier which I am glad about because it was really frustrating at first.

## Wheel

### Description

To make the wheel I first made 3 rectangles on top of eachother.  After I made the 3 rectangles and connected them i used the revolve tool to revolve it and make it into a wheel shape.  Then I made a curved rectangle on the side of the wheel and removed the inside.  I used the pattern tool to multiply it 4 times to make the spokes on the wheel.

### Evidence

### Image

### Reflection
This was the most fun piece to make in my opinion because I didnt really know where it was going to go.  3 rectangles turned into something that looked like a wheel in 1 click.  The pattern tool is very useful because you only have to make the part 1 time and then you can multiply it wherever you want.
